# calendar Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change render-booking-calendar. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Visual Status Representation
The calendar SHALL visually distinguish between dates based on their availability status using intuitive colors (e.g. Green = Available, Amber = Limited).

#### Scenario: Verify Availability Coloring
- **GIVEN** a `bookingData` object with different statuses.
- **WHEN** the calendar is rendered.
- **THEN** "Available" dates MUST show **emerald/green** accents, "Limited" MUST show **amber/gold** accents, and "Full" MUST show **slate/gray** accents with a strike-through.

### Requirement: Interactive Date Selection
The component SHALL allow users to select a single date and display its detailed status, restricted to future dates only.

#### Scenario: Prevent Past Date Selection
- **GIVEN** the current date is "Today"
- **WHEN** the calendar is displayed
- **THEN** all dates before and including "Today" MUST be disabled and non-selectable.

#### Scenario: Hide Availability for Past Dates
- **GIVEN** a date that is in the past but marked as "Available" in the data source
- **WHEN** the calendar renders
- **THEN** that date MUST NOT show the green availability accent and MUST be disabled.

### Requirement: Data Structure Compatibility
The component SHALL consume a simplified availability data structure where availability is inferred.

#### MODIFIED Scenario: Mock Data Integration
- **GIVEN** a `bookingData` structure (e.g. from `useBookingStore`)
- **WHEN** it contains `booked` and `limited` arrays of `Date` objects
- **THEN** any future date not present in these arrays MUST be treated as "available".
- **AND** all specified exception dates MUST be correctly mapped to their respective modifiers in the calendar component.

#### MODIFIED Scenario: Status Keys Consistency
- **GIVEN** the `STATUS_CONFIG` object
- **WHEN** statuses are assigned
- **THEN** the keys MUST be `available`, `limited`, and `booked` (for exceptions), and `standard` (for non-future dates).

### Requirement: Hover State Consistency
The component SHALL provide clear visual feedback when a user hovers over a date, while maintaining the visibility of its current status.

#### Scenario: Hover Feedback on Status Dates
- **GIVEN** an "Available" (Green) or "Limited" (Amber) date.
- **WHEN** the user hovers over that date.
- **THEN** the background color MUST subtly change (e.g., to a darker or lighter shade of the status color) to provide interaction feedback, instead of reverting to the generic hover style.

### Requirement: UI Simplification
The `BookingCalendar` SHALL NOT display redundant header titles, descriptions, or step indicators.

#### Scenario: No Header in BookingCalendar
- **Given** the user is on the `BookingCalendar`
- **Then** the text "Selecciona tu Tour y Fecha" MUST NOT be visible.
- **And** the text "Elige el tour que deseas realizar y busca un día disponible." MUST NOT be visible.

#### Scenario: No Step Indicator in Step 1
- **Given** the user is on the `BookingCalendar`
- **Then** the text "Paso 1 de 2" MUST NOT be visible.

### Requirement: Dynamic Limited Window
The calendar SHALL automatically mark the 10 days immediately following "Today" as "Limited" unless they are explicitly marked as "Booked".

#### Scenario: Verify Rolling 10-Day Window
- **GIVEN** "Today" is February 27, 2026.
- **WHEN** the calendar is rendered for any tour.
- **THEN** dates from February 28 to March 9 MUST be displayed with the "Limited" visual status (Amber).
- **AND** if March 1 was explicitly marked as "Booked" in the data, it MUST remain "Booked" (Slate).
